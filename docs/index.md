I am a recent graduate passionate about avian conservation and ecology. I have experience working with small owls, diurnal raptors and songbirds. Since early 2020, I have been working a waterbird conservation internship in Bahía de Kino, Sonora, México. I have experience working with GIS and performing a variety of statistical spatial analyses. I intend to apply to graduate school in the near future and hope to complete a project that combine my two primary interests- ornithology and spatial ecology.
