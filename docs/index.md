I am an avian ecologist particularly interested in all things quantitative and spatial! 
I completed my MS in Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology at New Mexico State University in May 2024, where I studied the effects of prairie dog colony characteristics and landscape patterns on Burrowing Owl nest survival and productivity.

I have previously worked with small owls, diurnal raptors, waterbirds and songbirds. I have experience performing a variety of statistical analyses on various longitudinal data sets, as well as extensive experience working with GIS.
