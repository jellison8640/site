title: R Work Samples
---

This page contains the links to show some of the different work I've done with R. I often go back to these documents as a refernce, but hope these documents serve a resource to people. 
I've presented a handful of different workshops to the "Working Group" within the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) for my departmentâ€” NMUS FWCE, which can be found below. 
Additionally, I have the code from a final project I did for a course in which I analyzed spatial point-patterns in R. 


Sample work is sorted from newest to oldest:
- Introductioon to Google Earth Engine in R with *rgee* (coming in Nov/Dec)
- Nest Survival Models with JAGS/jagsUI (hopefully coming soon!)
- Sampling Landscapes with *landscapemetrics* (in progress)
