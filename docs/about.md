# Hello!

<img align="right" src="photos/flam.jpg" width="375" height="500">
My name is Jordan! I have experience working with various types of birds but am most interested in working with raptors in the area of quantitative and/or spatial ecology. In January 2021, I began at New Mexico State University working towards a MS in Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology and graduated in May 2024. I earned a BA with Distinction in Organismal Biology and Ecology from Colorado College in 2019, where I completed an undergraduate thesis about the effects of predation of Flammulated Owls by Red Squirrels entitled [The Rodent Eats the Raptor](https://digitalccbeta.coloradocollege.edu/pid/coccc:31273 "My Thesis!").


## Projects

* Spatial Patterns of Burrowing Owl Nests and Landscape Effects on Reproduction advised by Dr. Martha Desmond and Dr. Fitsum Abadi Gebreselassie 
  * Effects of prairie dog colony characteristics on Burrowing Owl nest survival across the Great Plains
  * Determing factors influencing nest distribution patterns within prairie dog colonies across a latitudinal gradient 
  * Multi-scale effects of landscape configuration and composition on the nest survival and productivity of Burrowing Owls
* Flammulated Owl habitat selection in collaboration with Dr. Brian Linkhart and Kate McGinn
  * Analyzis of long-term data on nest site selection
  * Utilization of LiDAR dataset to extract biologically relevant characteristics to understand habitat quality
* Analysis of waterbird surveys in Bah√≠a de Kino, Sonora, Mexico in collaboration with Prescott College Kino Bay Center
  * Use of modeling to analyze trends in bird abundance over time
